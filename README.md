## DSA using Java

### Introduction

This repository contains Java code implementations for various data structures and algorithms. It serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing data structures and algorithms (DSA) using the Java programming language.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-java.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Set up your Java environment:**
   Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

### Usage

1. **Explore the code:**
   The repository is organized into different directories or packages, each containing implementations for specific data structures or algorithms.

2. **Run examples:**
   Most examples will include a `main` method that you can run directly to test the implementation.

3. **Modify and experiment:**
   Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different input values, and explore variations of the algorithms.
